		<div>Vespucci is based on the same tech used in video games and professional graphics software: the low-level Metal API. This, combined with patented in-house data processing approaches, allows us to process large amounts of data, unearthing behavior and patterns that you may not have anticipated.</div>
		<div>Our statistics models identify insights that you wouldn’t have thought of.</div>
		<div>App users are unpredictable, which is why publishers have started making video recordings of app sessions to try and not miss anything. Unfortunately, relying on video recordings introduces significant privacy and sampling challenges. We match the knowledge provided by video recordings, with many fewer constraints.</div>
		<div>Visualize the homogeneity of a behavior you have identified using the statistical tools built into Vespucci (e.g. users abandoning the app for a price > $79) over time.</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>Easy Integration with a new kind of API or via Segment.</div>
		<div>Once you have identified the right component (let's say the price) Vespucci highlights the values of this component (the different price ranges) that are likely to increase the probability of a defined behavior.</div>

		<div>Most analytics tools ask you to specify what you’re looking for. That’s a problem, because often you’re using analytics because you’re not sure what you’re looking for ! And even if you think you do, you could be closing the door on certain behaviors, missing hidden value. That’s why we’ve designed models that highlight the elements and content in your app that reveal remarkable behaviors.</div>

		<div>Once you have Vespucci’s insights, you can see how consistently they appear depending on your users’ geographies, times, or technologies. For example, these visualizations have helped a meal delivery service to see that users in the south of Brussels abandoned the app after seeing negative customer reviews, while users in the city center were relatively indifferent to those reviews.</div>
		<div>Combine multiple dimensions in a few clicks to reveal insights that would otherwise have been lost in your datasets.</div>
