		<div>It all starts with writing a (UX)Story. 
</div>
		<div>Visualize your story through dimensions.
</div>
		<div>Vespucci is able to manage content of a very heterogeneous nature. Let's take the example of a text. To handle them, we had to rely on learning machine models to offer  two main families of processing, one based on the emotional qualification  (particularly adapted to elements such as customer reviews) and the other based on the isolation of significant keywords. The latter treatment probably deserves a little  case: let's imagine a news app, it is full of long texts (articles) that are difficult to characterize. To achieve this characterization, Vespucci will isolate in these texts distinctive keywords (e.g. Coronavirus, Donald Trump, Brexit,...).</div>
		<div>Overview 
</div>
		<div>Introducing UXStories.
 No endless tags. No screen recording.
</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>Drived by Contents. Powered by Emotions.</div>
		<div>Sometimes your users are unforeseeable.
So we designed the StoryFinder, a statistical tool that brings the unforeseeable out of your data.

A technology that turns data into stories.</div>

		<div>We use Machine Learning technologies to translate raw data into something that makes sense to brand owners, product managers or investors: phrases based on emotions, categories or keywords. These technologies allow us to provide our users with queries such as "users who abandoned the app after reading a negative emotional customer review" or "users who went to the comments section after reading an article about Donald Trump".</div>

		<div>Vespucci is an analytics tool that helps you to understand how the content of your app shape the behavior of your users. We deliver the famous "Why" that everyone in the industry is talking about. Except that until now, to discover this "Why" you had to stuff your code with tags and plan assumptions in advance. Not only it's tedious, but it means missing what you didn't consider in your hypotheses. To avoid missing anything and having to anticipate, you could use solutions based on video recording of your users' screens. The problem is that this is not very "privacy firendly". That's why we came up with Vespucci. Vespucci offers the best of both worlds: an experience in which data is erased in favor of queries, conceived as sentences in natural language, based on concepts that make sense to everyone in an organization while offering high standards of privacy.</div>
		<div>A story alone is not a very interesting object. It is by visualizing it through dimensions like  time, technology or geography that it expresses all its value. These visualizations will allow for exemple a meal delivery app that people who abandon the app after consulting a negative customer review are those located in the south of Brussels while users in the center of the city are relatively indifferent to those reviews.


</div>
		<div>Most analytics tools ask you to specify what you are looking for. This is a problem because often you use these tools because you don't know what you're looking for, or maybe you think you do, but your data is closing in on behavior and therefore unsuspected value. That's why, together with statisticians, we designed the StoryFinder. The StoryFinder highlights the interface elements and contents of your app that are at the origin of remarkable behaviors.</div>
		<div>Vespucci automatically screens all the elements that make up the interface of a view. So you don't need tags or whatsoever. But that's juste the start. In some configurations, the same interface element can be replicated several times on the same view. For exemple, take a list of different restaurants in a delivery app or several products in an e-commerce app. To isolate the elements of interest among all those displayed Vespucci tracks the user’s interactions on the screen and isolates the elements with which the user has interacted.</div>
