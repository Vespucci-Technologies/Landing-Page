		<div>Introducing Vespucci, a new kind of analytics solution. Drived by AI. Powered by content & emotions.</div>
		<div>Only 70 % are leaving when reviews are 😀 positives</div>
		<div>In the field of advertising, the emotion reflected by the content is particularly valuable. Imagine that a user is exposed to content dealing with the autonomy constraints of electric vehicles. Our technology is able to associate, in real time, to this content, a category (the automobile) of keywords (autonomy...) and an emotion (negative). This is to allow a firm such as BMW to calibrate its advertising message by offering ads related to its hybrid car lineup or to its fast charging system.</div>
		<div>We strongly believe that the content of your application (the emotional content of a publication or the price of an item, ...) transforms the way your customers experience your app. We also think that you would not have to perform complex A/B testing experiments to understand how this transformation occurs. Your application probably already exposes your user to different contexts (an e-commerce app already contains dozens of shoes with different prices a delivery app comes with a ton of different delivery times), it is time to capture how this change the way your users reacts. Without complex implementations.</div>
		<div>When delivery time is > 25 min</div>
		<div>95% are leaving when 💶 price is > €200</div>
