		<div>Here is Vespucci.
 A technology that turns data into stories.</div>
		<div>A story alone is not a very interesting object. It is by visualizing it through dimensions like  time, technology or geography that it expresses all its value. These visualizations will allow for exemple a meal delivery app that people who abandon the app after consulting a negative customer review are those located in the south of Brussels while users in the center of the city are relatively indifferent to those reviews.

		<div>Automatic Detection & Tiering of Interface Elements.</div>
		<div>Most analytics tools ask you to specify what you are looking for. This is a problem because often you use these tools because you don't know what you're looking for, or maybe you think you do, but your data is closing in on behavior and therefore unsuspected value. That's why, together with statisticians, we designed the StoryFinder. The StoryFinder highlights the interface elements and contents of your app that are at the origin of remarkable behaviors.</div>
		<div>Vespucci analyzes how the content of your app shapes user behavior. You don’t need to wonder about “Why are they doing that?” anymore, or to stuff your code with tags and assumptions. Vespucci offers a better way: queries in natural language that make sense to everyone in your organization while also maintaining the highest privacy standards.</div>
		<div>Vespucci automatically screens all the elements that make up the interface of a view. So you don't need tags. Our technology also recognizes interface elements which are replicated across views (eg: several products in an e-commerce app for example)</div>
		<div>We use Machine Learning technologies to translate raw data into something that makes sense to brand owners, product managers or investors: phrases based on emotions, categories or keywords.</div>
		<div>No more tags & tagging plans  
The stories are all you had with the screen recordings. Plus the use at scale.</div>
		<div>As an exemple, your story can track user that order after seeing a negative review.

No endless tags. No screen recording.</div>
		<div>No more tags & tagging plans  
Our statistical tool brings out stories from your data. Even the ones you wouldn't have thought of.</div>
