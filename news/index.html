          <br/>
          <p>Until now, Vespucci consolidated the usage data of your systems based on two particular actions:
            "Application Opened" and "Application Backgrounded". These actions are quite natural if we consider a mobile application based on a transactional model.  Let's imagine an e-commerce app, the customer opens the app, consults some products, makes a purchase and finally closes the app. In such a case, the notion of session is quite straightforward and defining it on the basis of Opened and Backgrounded tracks makes a lot of sense. However, there are some apps for which the notion of Session is less direct, so defining them on the basis of these elements probably makes less sense. Finally, and this is probably the most important point, some digital experiences (a support conversation, the viewing of an advertisement) cannot be understood through a definition based on the supposed opening or closing of an app (since the product is potentially no longer an app). That's why we deploy today a new way to consolidate your sessions in Vespucci. An approach that no longer requires to define actions to track the opening or closing of the app. </p>
            <br>

            <br><br>
            <p>We call this new tracking method "Time Based Tracking". It consists in defining the session on the basis of a temporal criterion. Vespucci will analyze the timestamp of each of the DataLayers you are sending and try to consolidate them into concurrent events.</p>
            <p>This approach is available today on your dashboard. To activate it, create a new project and specify "Time Based Tracking" in the new "Tracking Method" menu.</p>

          <h2 id="Introducing_Vespucci_1.3">Introducing Vespucci 1.3, Data Science for Everyone.</h2>
          <p class="text-light"><small>Published on April 21, 2021</small></p>
          <img src="img/blogScreen.001.png" alt="Vespucci Advanced Techs" width="950oh" height="600">
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <p>We are very pleased to announce Vespucci 1.3. Vespucci 1.3 is part of our vision to industrialize analytics. Currently, data analysis is a craft process where the quality of the insights depends on the quality of the one who is looking for them. We want to change this by putting the computer in control. This opens new possibilities, as soon as you have a computer, you have your own data scientist. This allows us to put our tools in the hands of many new actors within an organization. To build up on this vision, we wanted to make Vespucci usable in new situations, with new types of data. We also wanted to reduce the friction between the data and the user by further refining the user interface to make it even more familiar or by reducing the wait during the initial preparation of the data.<br/><br/>This was our goal in designing Vespucci 1.3. Vespucci 1.3 introduces new ways to create value with your data and contains 1001 refinements to make the experience even more enjoyable for everyone. Here is an overview of some of the new features.</p>
          <br>
          <h4>Introducing a new category of Data Story.</h4>
          <p>Until now, Vespucci had been designed around user journey. You had rich tools to trace transitions from one view to another in your app while Vespucci helped you isolate the drivers of such behaviours. However, this approach does not fit all product categories. Some experiences are not built around user journeys or flows but around key actions you want to track. These are, for example, users who perform actions on a given view such as adding an item to their favorites, entering a promotional coupon... <br><br/>That's why we are introducing a new kind of story, based on actions. Getting started is very easy. You just have to describe, through a visual editor, the action you want to investigate and then, the Story Finder takes care of the rest and helps you to identify its drivers. We rely on AI and neural engine on compatible devices to help you write new kind of stories.</p>
          <br>
          <img src="img/heroStory.gif" alt="Vespucci Advanced Techs" width="950oh" height="600">
          <br><br>
          <ul>
            <li>üõí In an app or e-commerce website, find out what makes users still add an item to their cart despite reading a customer review with negative emotional content.</li>
            <li>‚òéÔ∏è In a customer support platform, determine what drives your users to open a ticket through which they express their dissatisfaction.</li>
            <li>üåÆ In a meal delivery app, determine what drives your users to place an order despite a delivery time of over 45min.</li>
          </ul>
          We are super excited about this new category of story ! It will allow us to unleash the potential of Vespucci to a whole new bunch of users.<br/>

          <br>
          <h4>A refined user interface.</h4>
          <p>A key element in our vision of bringing analytics to everyone in an organization is the user interface. It is the one that must give the data a familiar and welcoming character. Vespucci 1.3 introduces multiple improvements to the user interface that reflect the feedback from our early users. Thus the interface has been re-designed to make it more readable, especially in light mode, while we have completely redesigned the settings panel and improved the filter system. We hope you will love ‚ù§Ô∏è this improved interface.</p>

          <br><br>

          <h4>A faster engine.</h4>
          <p>Nobody likes to wait. That's why we've rewritten our synchronization system to make it even faster. The processing of your data during the initial configuration of Vespucci is up to 4.5 times faster<sup>1</sup>.</p>

          <br><br>
          <p>Vespucci 1.3 will be available for download next week.</p><br/>
          <p style="font-size: 9px;"><sup>1</sup>Testing conducted using a 3.8GHz 8‚Äëcore 10th-generation Intel Core i7 based 27‚Äëinch iMac system with 16GB of RAM using a pre-version of Vespucci 1.3 and Vespucci 1.2.4. Performance tests are conducted using specific computer systems and reflect the approximate performance of Vespucci.</p>
